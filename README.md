# Sarah's Tech Basic II Exam project

This repository contains Sarah Haq's Tech Basics II Exam Project code. 


This repository should contain the following:
- Your report as a pdf file.
- Your python code `app.py` that carries out all the steps to build you MVP and if you are using any helper scripts, this should be placed in a separate folder.
- Any images/music or supporting files. Please store this is a separate folder. 
- A README file. This a markdown file that introduces and explains the projects. I am just expecting you to update the header and a few lines on what to expect in your repository. However, if you want to do more, check out this resource [here](https://www.makeareadme.com/).



The `helpers.py` python script in the src folder contains two definitions that might be handy for you - clearing the widgets and placing a background image.
